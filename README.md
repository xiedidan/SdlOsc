# SdlOsc
Oscilloscope Client based on SDL &amp; OpenGL  
###**Still working in progress.**
## Description
BeScope kit from www.arrow.com includes a pretty good AD9286 daughter board. However the demo scope program is so weak, that we couldn't observe any low freqency signal with it. So I build up this program to release the kit's full power as an oscilloscope.
